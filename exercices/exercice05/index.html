    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    <p>Hi there.</p>

    <p>I am Marc-Olivier Lamothe, a young designer. But what does that means? Where do I come from?</p>

  <p>So I am a designer. I must say, it took me an incredible scholar journey to arrive at this conclusion. It all started at high school, during an english project. We had to make a short video for the class, and I got introduced to iMovie. As soon as I started editing, I knew I wanted to have a job that would work along with computers. I did as much video projects as I could until I had to decide where to go for my Cegep. I made the choice to do a Technique in Multimedia at Cegep Ã‰douard-Montpetit. I thought I would get better at video editing, and I did, but what changed my life was the introduction do Design. At that time, it was mostly just graphic design, but it was a good start. After my Cegep, I went to Concordia and that is when I started understanding the meaning of the word Design better, and all the possibilities and responsibilities that a designer has. So here I am now, close to the end of my academic journey, and full of determination to start my career!</p>
